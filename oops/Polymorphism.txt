🔹 Core Definition

Polymorphism means “many forms”.

One method or object behaves differently depending on context.

Enables the same interface to represent different implementations.

Strongly connected with inheritance and interfaces.

🔹 Types of Polymorphism in Java

1️⃣ Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)

Achieved using Method Overloading.

Same method name, different parameter list.

Decision made at compile time.

Based on number, type, or order of parameters.

Return type alone cannot differentiate overloaded methods.


2️⃣ Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)

Achieved using Method Overriding.

Same method signature in parent and child class.

Decision made at runtime.

Based on actual object type (not reference type).

Also called Dynamic Method Dispatch.
