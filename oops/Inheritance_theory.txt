🔹 Core Definition

Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to acquire properties and behaviors of another class (superclass).

Implemented using the extends keyword.

Represents an IS-A relationship.

Supports code reusability and hierarchical classification.

🔹 Key Terminology

Superclass / Parent class → Class being inherited.

Subclass / Child class → Class that inherits.

Base class / Derived class → Alternative terms.

IS-A relationship → Fundamental concept behind inheritance.

🔹 Types of Inheritance in Java

Single Inheritance → One child, one parent.

Multilevel Inheritance → Grandparent → Parent → Child.

Hierarchical Inheritance → One parent, multiple children.

Multiple Inheritance → Not supported with classes.

Multiple Inheritance via Interfaces → Supported using implements.

Hybrid Inheritance → Achieved using interfaces.

🔹 Why Java Doesn’t Support Multiple Inheritance (Classes)

To avoid Diamond Problem.

Prevents ambiguity in method resolution.

Maintains simplicity in object model.
